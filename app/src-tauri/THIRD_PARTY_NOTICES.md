## tauri-plugin-webdriver

Parts of attn's browser automation executor and macOS JavaScript dialog handler
are adapted from `tauri-plugin-webdriver` 0.2.1:

https://github.com/Choochmeque/tauri-plugin-webdriver

The adapted code targets attn's dynamically created child `tauri::Webview`,
uses attn's authenticated daemon transport instead of the plugin's HTTP server,
and does not depend on the plugin at build or runtime.
