# attn profiles

A **profile** fully isolates an attn install: its own data directory, socket,
websocket port, macOS app bundle, and bundle identifier. Profiles let several
agents run attn — and its tests — side by side without colliding.

**One knob: `ATTN_PROFILE`.** Set it once in a shell and every entrypoint (CLI,
daemon, frontend e2e, real-app harness, build) targets the same isolated world.
You never set per-entrypoint profile variables by hand.

```
attn profile-env agent7 | source     # fish:  set ATTN_PROFILE=agent7
eval "$(attn profile-env agent7)"     # bash/zsh
attn profile-env --unset | source     # back to the default profile
```

## See where you are

```
attn profile            # status of the active profile
attn profile list       # every profile with data and/or an installed app
```

`attn profile status` prints the resolved data dir, socket, port, bundle id,
app path, and e2e ports, and whether the daemon socket / app are present. Any
non-default `attn` command also prints a one-line `[attn profile=… socket=…
port=…]` banner so you can never lose track of which world you are touching.

## The single authority: `attn profile resolve`

Every resource a profile maps to is derived in exactly one place
(`internal/config`) and surfaced by `resolve`. Tooling (the Makefile, the e2e
harness, the real-app harness) reads `resolve` instead of re-deriving — so the
mapping can never drift between entrypoints.

```
attn profile resolve --json                 # full resolution as JSON
attn profile resolve --field wsPort          # one value (scripting)
attn profile resolve --profile dev --field bundleId
```

Resolved keys: `profile, label, dataDir, socket, dbPath, wsPort, bundleId,
appName, appPath, deepLinkScheme, e2eDaemonPort, e2eVitePort`.

## What maps to what

| Resource | default | dev | named (e.g. `agent7`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data dir | `~/.attn` | `~/.attn-dev` | `~/.attn-agent7` |
| WS port | 9849 | 29849 | hash → `[20000,29848]` |
| Bundle id | `com.attn.manager` | `…​.dev` | `…​.agent7` |
| App | `attn.app` | `attn-dev.app` | `attn-agent7.app` |
| Deep-link scheme | `attn` | `attn-dev` | `attn-agent7` |
| e2e daemon port | 19849 | hash → `[30000,30999]` | hash → `[30000,30999]` |
| e2e Vite port | 1421 | hash → `[31000,31999]` | hash → `[31000,31999]` |

Port bands are disjoint by construction: a throwaway e2e daemon never collides
with a *real* daemon of the same profile. Names match `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,15}`.

## Running tests under a profile

| Suite | Command | Isolation |
|---|---|---|
| Go unit/integration | `make test` | already parallel-safe (each test uses `t.TempDir()` + explicit `ATTN_*` env; never touches `~/.attn`) |
| Frontend e2e | `make test-e2e` | derives this profile's e2e daemon + Vite ports *(wired in a later PR)* |
| Real-app scenarios | `pnpm --dir app run real-app:…` | targets this profile's daemon/app *(wired in a later PR)* |

So two agents in separate worktrees with distinct `ATTN_PROFILE` values can run
the Go and (soon) e2e suites concurrently with no cross-talk.

## Safety model — hard to point the wrong profile at the wrong place

- **Prod is sacred.** `make`, `make install`, `make install-daemon` refuse at
  parse time if `ATTN_PROFILE` is set (they target the prod bundle). Use
  `make dev` or `make install PROFILE=<name>`.
- **The packaged app is bound to its build profile.** A profile's `.app` pins
  `ATTN_PROFILE`/`ATTN_WS_PORT` and strips inherited routing env at launch, so
  it can never reach another profile's daemon.
- **Daemon isolation is enforced.** The daemon refuses to start if its socket
  root and database would straddle two profiles, and restarts when the running
  daemon's profile no longer matches the caller's.
- **Single authority.** Because every entrypoint derives from `attn profile
  resolve`, there is no hand-synced per-entrypoint mapping to get wrong.

## Lifecycle

| Step | How |
|---|---|
| Pick | `attn profile-env <name> \| source` |
| Inspect | `attn profile` / `attn profile list` |
| Build + install app | `make install PROFILE=<name>` *(later PR)* |
| Sign | uniform stable identity via `scripts/macos-codesign-identity.sh`; macOS grants persist per bundle id |
| Clean | `attn profile clean <name>` — stop daemon, remove data dir + app, forget the bundle *(later PR)* |

## Rollout status

This page describes the target model. Landed so far: the `internal/config`
authority, `attn profile status|resolve|list`, and Go-test parallel-safety. The
e2e port wiring, real-app harness profile resolution, per-profile app build, and
`attn profile clean` land in subsequent PRs (see
`docs/plans/2026-06-13-parallel-profiles.md`).
